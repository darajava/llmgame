## run frontend with

```
npm run dev
```

After installing node modules (`npm i`)

## run server with

```
deno run -A --watch src/index.ts
```

I have never used deno before so not sure how to or if you need to install packages.

put a file called `.env` with your OpenAI api key in the root of `server/`
